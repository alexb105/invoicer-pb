- Sends comprehensive data context to ChatGPT API
- Receives intelligent, formatted responses from OpenAI
- Maintains conversation history for context

### ChatGPT Integration
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model for intelligent responses
- Sends comprehensive invoice data as context to ChatGPT
- Maintains conversation history for better context understanding
- Handles API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Supports natural language queries without predefined patterns

## Customization

### Adding New Query Types
To add support for new query types:

1. Add intent detection in `analyzeIntent()` method
